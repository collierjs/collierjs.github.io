	<p align="justify">My doctoral thesis examines the diffuse and decentralised nature of cyber security provision. With a variety of both public and private actors providing cyber security in various contexts, my research seeks to understand what these networks (or assemblages) of security actors look like: who are the relevant players, what are their incentive structures, where does power lie, and what does this all mean for the how private actors have emerged as vital providers of security? The DPhil in Cyber Security has involved a number of taught modules in topics including business risk management, network architecture and cyber crime as well as two research projects focused on cyber crisis management and public-private partnerships.</p>

	<p align="justify">Outside of my doctoral project, I am becoming increasingly interested in the geopolitical and strategic dimensions of threat intelligence. I have also previously examined a variety of cyber security issues including e-government, encryption, critical infrastructure and the changing role of signals intelligence agencies. I have recently also started to consider ethical leadership in the context of cyber security.</p>
